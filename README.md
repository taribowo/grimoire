## Disclaimer
I usually used DomDomSoft Manga Reader for all of my locally owned digital manga reading. But it has its own problems, such as always crashing when trying to open a really big directory, and since we all know that DomDomSoft is no more (RIP), there won't be any updates to address these issues, so i decided to make my own manga reader.

This is also my first attempt at creating a React app and Electron App, let alone React+Electron App, so this app is most likely not conforming to any best practice out there. I hope that someone can point out any area that i can improve
